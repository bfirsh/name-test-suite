# Naming test suite

This is a list of requirements I've used for naming products/projects/tools. It leans somewhat towards developer tools, because that is what I usually make, but it is probably useful for naming all sorts of things.

My usual process involves using Google, Wikipedia, Thesauruses to explore around a topic. Perhaps finding similar concepts in fiction. I'll usually pick a single word, unless some amalgamation works particularly well (e.g. GitHub). I don't use a silly made-up name unless it's really good.

Then, once I've got a list of potential names, I'll run them through the test suite. That'll usually leave a shortlist, then I just pick the one that feels right.

- **[Are there domains available/squatted?](https://domainr.com)** Including common misspellings and variations.
- **Are social accounts available/unused?** What about appending "hq", "project", etc?
  - Twitter
  - GitHub
- **Is package available on the main language repository?** (e.g. [PyPi](https://pypi.org), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com))
- **Can it be mistaken for something similar?**
- **Can it be misspelled easily?**
- **Is its pronounciation unambiguous?** Though this doesn't matter if you want smug know-it-alls as your users. (See also: La Croix.)
- **Is it memorable?** Wait a day and see if you can remember it.
- **[What do the Google results look like?](https://www.google.com/)**
- **[What do the GitHub search results look like?](https://github.com/search)**
- **Can you say/hear it in a loud bar?**
- **Can you say the domain without spelling it out or clarifying things?** Not this situation: "Flickr, like a light flickering, but without the E. F-L-I-C-K-R. Dot com."
- **Is it easy to type?** [Some words flow across the QWERTY keyboard much more easily than others.](https://clig.dev/#naming)
- **[Is the trademark available?](https://www3.wipo.int/branddb/en/)** Maybe important for you if you're a company.
- **Does it make sense in sentences?**
    - You should try out X it's really neat
    - Put it on X
    - ... other sentences that people might say to others about your thing
- **Does it make sense as a prefix for related things?** If you're naming something larger, or something with the potential to be larger.
    - X Cloud
    - X Pro
    - ... other things that might make sense as being part of your thing
